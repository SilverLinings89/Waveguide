# The 3D Maxwell Project

This code was developed by Pascal Kraft in an effort to generate a fast code to compute optimal shapes of 3D-waveguides based on a solution of the full Maxwell-Problem without simplifications based on non-physical assumptions. 

Core elements are a refined adjoint based optimization scheme and a sweeping preconditioner. 

This is a work in progress and not currently ready for general usage. Please refer to pascal.kraft@kit.edu for more information.

# Thanks

My thanks go to the CRC 1173 which is funding my research.
