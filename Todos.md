Next Steps:

Before I implement new functionality I want to increase code quality. To that end, I want to:
├── Migrate completely to smart pointers
│   ├── This should increase performance slightly and maybe offer me a better understanding of the topic
│   └── Use this to see if architectural improvements are possible.
└── Migrate completely to range based iterators wherever possible.
