Next Steps:

Befor I implement new functionality I want to increase code quality. To that end, I want to:
# Create better typings
## Make code more readable
## Go through the code to understand where work is required
# Get rid of all warnings
## There are some warnings in my code that I can easily resolve and use as a further cursor to navigate the code
## There are some deprecation warnings in dealii
# Migrate completely to smart pointers
## This should increase performance slightly and maybe offer me a better understanding of the topic
## Use this to see if architectural improvements are possible.
# Migrate completely to range based iterators wherever possible.
